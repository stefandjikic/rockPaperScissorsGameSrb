# My first game in HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
This is is serbian version of game rock, paper and scissors. I was inspired by watching some JavaScript tutorials by DevEd on youtube, and decided to create mine own game with serbian motives.  
The purpose of this project is pure fun and improving skills in JavaScript.
