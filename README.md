## My first game in HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
This is a Serbian version of game Rock, paper and scissors. I was inspired by watching some JavaScript tutorials by DevEd on Youtube, and decided to create my own game with Serbian motives.  
The purpose of this project is pure fun and improvement of JavaScript skills.
